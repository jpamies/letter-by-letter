# Current Development Iteration: Second Iteration

## Status
🔄 In Progress

## Goals
- Implement actual letter services (A-Z)
- Implement number services (0-9)
- Implement special character service
- Update orchestrator to call actual services instead of mocks

## Implementation Plan

### Letter Services
1. Create a base letter service template
2. Implement services for each letter (A-Z) using the template
3. Each service should:
   - Accept a request with styling parameters
   - Generate an image of the letter with the specified styling
   - Return the image data

### Number Services
1. Create a base number service template
2. Implement services for each digit (0-9) using the template
3. Each service should follow the same pattern as letter services

### Special Character Service
1. Implement a single service that handles all special characters
2. Support common special characters (space, period, comma, etc.)
3. Follow the same interface as letter and number services

### Orchestrator Updates
1. Update the orchestrator to discover and call the actual services
2. Implement error handling for service failures
3. Add request routing logic based on character type

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for each service
2. Integration tests for the orchestrator with actual services
3. End-to-end tests for the complete flow

## Completion Criteria
- All letter services (A-Z) implemented and tested
- All number services (0-9) implemented and tested
- Special character service implemented and tested
- Orchestrator successfully routes requests to appropriate services
- End-to-end flow works with actual services
