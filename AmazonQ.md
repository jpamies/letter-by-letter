# Next Steps for Letter-by-Letter Image Generator

## Second Iteration
- Implement actual letter services (A-Z)
- Implement number services (0-9)
- Implement special character service
- Update orchestrator to call actual services instead of mocks

## Third Iteration
- Add detailed metrics collection
- Implement distributed tracing
- Create visualization dashboard for service performance
- Add load testing capabilities

## Final Stage
- Create Kubernetes manifests for EKS deployment
- Configure EKS AutoMode settings
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Document scaling behaviors and performance characteristics

## Deployment Notes

- CI/CD pipeline is configured in AWS console
- ECR repositories are set up for all services
- GitHub repository is connected to AWS CodeBuild
- EKS cluster is configured with AutoMode enabled

## Development Guidelines

- Each service should include a Dockerfile for containerization
- Services should expose health check endpoints
- Implement graceful shutdown for all services
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow the microservices design pattern for new services
